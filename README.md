# Elara Services: Tickets

This is a customizable ticket system that uses interactions and discord.js


# Getting Started
```js
const { Client } = require("discord.js"),
    Tickets = require(`@elara-services/tickets`),
    client = new Client({ intents: ["GUILDS"] }),
    tickets = new Tickets({
        client,
        prefix: "support", // This is what is used for interactions (buttons) and the start of the channel name
        ticketCategory: "", // When tickets get created they get created in this category, (OPTIONAL) - Default is the category ID for the starter message's channel.
        encryptToken: "ASB!@#$%^&*(B", // This is to encrypt/decrypt the user IDs in the channel topic, to avoid non-staff from seeing who's ticket it is
        debug: true, // Only use if you want errors logged.
        ticketOpen: {
            content: "", // The content of the ticket message once it gets created, use "%user%" or "%server%" for the user mention or server name
            embeds: [], // View https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-object 
        },
        appeals: { // OPTIONAL
            enabled: true, // If the appeals server checks should be enabled.
            mainserver: {
                id: "", // The main server's id 
                checkIfBanned: true // Check if the user is banned in the main server, if not they can't open a ticket.
            },
            embeds: {
                not_banned: {} // The embeds, content and components for the not banned message. 
            }
        },

                    style: 2, // 1 (SHORT ANSWER) | 2 (LONG ANSWER)
                    placeholder: "", // The placeholder of the question
                    value: "", // The default value for the question
                    required: true, // If the question should be required
                    min_length: 20, // The min length for the question response
                    max_length: 4000, // The max length for the question response
                }
            ]
        },
        webhook: {
